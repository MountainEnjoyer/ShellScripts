## What is Wget
  - wget is a free utility for non-interactive dowload of files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, and retrieval throuh HTTP proxies.
  - Wget is a non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on, wich allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting wget finish the work.
