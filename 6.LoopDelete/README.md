## for loop in shell scripting
  - For loop contains a number of values in the list and will execute for each item in the list. For example, if there are 10 values in the list, then loop will execute ten times and each value will be stored in varname.
  - Usage:
  ```
  fot table in 1 2 3 4 
  do
    echo "value in $table"
  done
```
  - Check for directory type in current working directory : ```find . -type d.```
