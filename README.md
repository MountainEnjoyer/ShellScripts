## What is shebang in Linux shell scripting ?

- #!/bin/bash 
- This #! is called shebang or hashbang. The shebang plays an important role in shell scripting, specially while dealing with different types of shell.
- The shebang is the combination of the # (pound key) and ! (exclamation mark). This character combination has a special meaning when it's used in the very first line of the script. It is used to specify the interpreter with wich the given script will be runed by default.
- So, if the first line of a script is: ~!/bin/bash. It means the interpreter should be bash shell.
